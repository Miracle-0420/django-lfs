How to use product filters
==========================

In this how-to you will learn how to use product filters.

First we will add the corresponding filter portlet:

1. Go to the shop's management interface
2. Go to Shop / Preferences

Go to the "Portlets" tab

3. Select "Filter" portlet and click "Add portlet". Enter "Filter" in the
   Title field and click "Save portlet". You should now see the filter
   portlet within the left slot.

Now we will add properties, which are the base for the product filters.

4. Go to Properties / Properties.
5. Add a new property by clicking "Add property". (If there is no  property
   at all yet you will see the "Add property" form automatically).
6. Enter the "Name" of the property, in our case "Size" and click
   "Add property".
7. Go to "Field type" and select "Select field". Click "Save property type".
8. Now go to "Options" and fill in the "Name" field. In our case "Small".
   Click "Add option".
9. Repeat Step 8 for "Middle" and "Large". Now you should see three options
   within property "Size": "Small", "Middle" and "Large".

Now will will add a property group. Please note that every property has to
belong exactly one property group in order to use it with a product.

10. Got to Properties / Property Groups
11. Add a new property group by clicking "Add property group". (If there is no
    property group at all yet you will see the "Add property group" form
    automatically).
12. Enter the "Name" of the property, in our case "T-Shirts" and click
    "Add property group".
    
Go to the "Properties" tab

13. Select "Size" and click "Assign properties". You should now see "Size"
    within "Assigned properties".
    
Go to Catalog / Products

14. Add a new product clicking "Add product". (If there is no product at all 
    yet you will see the "Add product" form automatically).
15. Fill in "Name" "T-Shirt One" and "Price" "10.00" and click "Add product"

Go to the properties tab

16. Select our "Property group" "T-Shirts" and click "Update property groups"
17. Select "Size" Small
18. Repeat Steps 14 - 17 for "T-Shirt Two" and "T-Shirt Three" and assign
    sizes "Middle" and "Large" and prices 100.00 and 1000.00. Now you should 
    have three products "T-Shirt One", "T-Shirt Two" and T-Shirt Three" each 
    with sizes "Small", "Middle" or "Large" and prices "10.00", "100.00", 
    "1000.00".
