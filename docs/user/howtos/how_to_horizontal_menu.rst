Step by Step

1. Go to Management / Shop / Actions.

   will be automatically redirected to the ``Add action`` form.
3. Enter the ``Title``. This will be displayed on the horizontal menu.

   whatever you want.
5. Select ``Active``. Only active actions are displayed.
6. Enter the ``Position``. The actions are ordered from left to right, lower
   numbers right.
