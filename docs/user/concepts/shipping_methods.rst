================

This section descibes the shipping methods of LFS in general.

Overview:
=========

* You can add as many shipping methods as you want.

* All valid shipping methods are displayed for selection to the shop customer.

* A shipping method is valid if all criteria of the shipping method are true.

* Shipping methods can have many prices which are dependent of criteria. The
  first price which is valid (all criteria are true) is the current price for
  the shipping method. If no price is valid the default price is taken (from
  the ``Data`` tab).
