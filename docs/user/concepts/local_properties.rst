Local Properties
================

This section describes what local properties are and how and where there are
used.

Overview
========

Local properties are added to a single product. They are a just convenient way
to create :ref:`variants <products_concepts_product_with_variants>`. In contrary
to :doc:`global properties </user/concepts/properties>` they can not be used to
create :ref:`configurable products <products_concepts_configurable_product>`,
filtering or other features which are provided by global properties.
