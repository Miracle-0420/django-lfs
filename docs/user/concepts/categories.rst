Categories

This section describes the concepts of categories.

Overview
========

Categories are used to structure :doc:`products <products>`.

Every category can have either one or no parent category. In this way the
category tree is built. If the category has no parent it's a  top level
category.

Every category can have an arbitrary amount of products or sub categories. What
is displayed is up to the selected template and selected format informations
like amount of columns and rows of displayed products.

A category can have :doc:`portlets <portlets>`. By default the portlets are
inherited from the parent category or the shop (for top level categories) and to
the sub categories and assigned products but they can be blocked per
:term:`slot`.

A category can have a :doc:`static block <static_blocks>` which is displayed on
top of the category.
