This section describes the concept of delivery times.

Concept
=======

Delivery times are used to calculate the total delivery time for single products
or the total cart.

The common way how to use delivery time is to assign them to :ref:`shipping
methods <shipping_methods_concepts>`. The delivery time of a product and the
total cart is then calculated by LFS automatically based on the current selected
shipping method which can be differ based on the customer, the shipping country
or total weight of all products within the cart, etc.

It is also possible to overwrite this mechanism for single products.
