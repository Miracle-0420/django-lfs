This section describes the actions of LFS.

Overview
========

* ``Actions`` are used to place links on several locations within the shop.

* The ``Action Group`` decides the place where the action is displayed.

* An ``Action`` belongs to exactly one action group.

* LFS ships with two ``Action Groups``: ``Tabs`` (horizontal menu bar) and
  ``Footer``.

* Developers can easily :ref:`add more action groups
  <how_to_add_own_action_groups>`.
