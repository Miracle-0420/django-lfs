Contribution Translations
=========================

There are two preferred ways to contribute translations:

Via DVCS
========

If your are a (Django-)developer you might want to fork django-lfs and
django-lfstheme on `Bitbucket <https://bitbucket.org/diefenbach/django-lfs>`_ or
`GitHub <https://github.com/diefenbach/django-lfs>`_, add the translations as
`used to <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/i18n/translation
/#localization-how-to-create-language-files>`_, commit them and send us a pull
request.

Via Transifex
=============

If your are a translator you can just go to `transifex
<https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/lfs/>`_, choose or add the language of
your choice and start to translate via the web interface. Once you are ready we
would add your translations to the source code.

Other
=====

If none of these fit your workflow you can of course just send us the
translation files.
