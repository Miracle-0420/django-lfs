How to add a horizontal menu
============================

In this how-to you will learn how to add a horizontal menu.

By default there is no automatically horizontal menu. You can add so-called 
actions to add one.

For that please do the following steps:

1. Go to LFS's management interface. 
2. Go to "Shop" / "Actions"
3. Click on "Add action". Please note: if there are no actions yet at all you 
   will be automatically redirected to the "Add action" form.
4. Enter the "Title". This will be displayed on the horizontal menu.
5. Enter the "Link". This is just a URL, e.g. to a "Category", a "Page" or 
   whatever you want
6. Select "Active". Only active actions are displayed. 
7. Enter the "Position". The actions are ordered from left to right.
8. Repeat Steps 3. - 7. for every action.
